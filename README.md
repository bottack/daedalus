This bash script automates a full web reconnaissance workflow for a given domain, integrating tools like Amass, Subfinder, Assetfinder, Httpx, DNSx, Naabu, Nuclei, GAU, and FFUF. It performs passive and active subdomain enumeration, resolves and probes live hosts, scrapes JavaScript files, fuzzes for hidden directories, scans ports, and checks for known CVEs. Results are saved in organized output files under a recon-specific directory.
